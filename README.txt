Add an Elizaibots chatbot to your wordpress site using the shortcode to embed the bot and conversation on your blog. Keep your readers amused!

== Description ==

Embed a chatbot on your blog to allow readers to talk to a Program O chatbot. 
When submitted an ajax request is fired to http://api.program-o.com/v2.3.1 to retrieve a response to display in the chat div. You can talk to 3 chatbots; 

* Shakespearebot
* Program O
* Carlos (a very funny comedy bot) 

All requests are handled via ajax so there is no nasty page reloading.
This is a very simple and clean plugin. 
Get your readers chatting to a chatbot and keep them on your site for hours.

If you have your own installation of Program O you can link to your own bot with a very simple URL change in the code so you can talk to your own personal chatbot.
